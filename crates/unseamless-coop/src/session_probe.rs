//! Rung-3 RE prep: instrumentation for the **session create/join initiation** — the one networking
//! gap the SDK doesn't chart (see [`docs/COOP-CONNECTION.md`](../../../docs/COOP-CONNECTION.md) >
//! "What the SDK gives us vs. the RE gap" and [`docs/SDK-COVERAGE.md`](../../../docs/SDK-COVERAGE.md)).
//! The SDK gives us the FSM *state* (`CSSessionManager.{lobby_state, protocol_state}`), the roster,
//! and the transport vtable — but **not** the internal functions that drive
//! `lobby_state None -> TryToCreateSession -> Host` (host) and `None -> TryToJoinSession -> Client`
//! (joiner). Finding those is rig-gated RE; this module is the scaffold that makes that run cheap.
//!
//! It ships **gated** (`[debug.probes] session_probe`, off by default) and splits into two surfaces,
//! both emitting the unique, greppable `session-probe:` prefix so a *batched* rig run (several lanes,
//! one game launch) can `grep session-probe:` and read exactly the create/join story out of the log:
//!
//! 1. **FSM rising-edge logger** ([`SessionFsmProbe`], a frame task) — logs every lobby/protocol
//!    transition with its frame number, plus the live `CSSessionManager` base address once. This half
//!    is **fully exercised solo**: without a peer it just sits at `lobby=None`, but the transition-
//!    detection machinery runs and is correct, ready for the two-player run. Reads through the shared
//!    [`crate::session::read`] (the same path the observer + diag report use) so the probe sees the
//!    session identically and there's one session-read path, not a parallel one to drift.
//! 2. **Create/join entry hooks** ([`install_hooks`]) — once the initiation-function AOBs are charted
//!    on the rig, a `jmp-back` hook at each entry logs the call and its argument registers (the
//!    candidate `this` pointer + peer SteamID), correlated by frame/timestamp to the FSM transition
//!    the call triggers. This half is **inert until an address lands**: the AOB landmarks below are
//!    `None` (a precise TODO), so `install_hooks` logs "not yet charted" and installs nothing. Filling
//!    [`SESSION_CREATE_SITE`] / [`SESSION_JOIN_SITE`] is the *only* remaining step — the whole install
//!    path (resolve landmark, place the hook, log) already compiles and is in place.
//!
//! The hand-off recipe (which two functions, why they're the create/join initiation, how to AOB-scan
//! for them, what `session-probe:` lines mean) is [`docs/SESSION-RE-RUNBOOK.md`](../../../docs/SESSION-RE-RUNBOOK.md).
//!
//! ## Clean-room
//! Everything here is grounded in the public SDK (the charted FSM enums/fields) or in our own
//! observations; no upstream ERSC code or decompiler output is transcribed (CLAUDE.md > Clean-room).
//!
//! ## Lifetime & safety
//! The entry hooks (when live) follow the same invariants as [`crate::saves`]: installed once on the
//! init thread, `mem::forget`-ten (resident for the process lifetime — never unhook a live code
//! path). The callbacks are **read-only** — they log register values and never write game memory or
//! dereference a pointer they were handed, so a probe can't perturb the session it's observing.

// RIG TODO (rung 3): the create/join initiation function entries are not charted by the SDK and can
// only be found with the game running. Until then both sites are `None` and the hook half is inert
// (the FSM logger above still works solo). A static pass (docs/SESSION-RE-FINDINGS.md) charted the
// supporting anchors and proved this must be a *runtime write-watch*, not a static byte scan:
//   - The live `CSSessionManager` is `[0x143d7a4d0]`, == the `base` the FSM logger prints below.
//   - `lobby_state` (+0xc; the vftable is 8 bytes + `unk8` u32, so the FSM pair is at +0xc/+0x10, NOT
//     +0x8) is written on the singleton by a *register* store, never an immediate — so scanning for
//     `C7 4? 0C 01/04` finds only unrelated objects (it was tried; see the findings doc).
// To chart, follow docs/SESSION-RE-RUNBOOK.md > step 2 (strategy A):
//   1. Frida-watch a 4-byte write on `base + 0xc`; host once (→1 = create) and join once (→4 = join).
//      The watch names the writing instruction on the first `None →` edge.
//   2. Walk back to the enclosing function's prologue; translate ~16 unique entry bytes to a pelite
//      pattern (one `?` per wildcard byte). Mind that the writer is a `this`-param callee — hook the
//      outermost initiation entry the host/join path calls, per the captured stack.
//   3. Set the const below to `Some(HookSite { landmark: pattern!("…"), offset: …, expect: 0x.. })`
//      and rebuild. `install_hooks` then resolves + hooks it; watch for the `session-probe: hooked …`
//      line, then the `session-probe: create-session initiated …` line on a real connect.
